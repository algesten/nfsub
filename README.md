Subtitles for Netflix

### Disclaimer

This script is in no way affiliated or endorsed by Netflix. Use at your own peril.

Motivation
----------

My boyfriend is British and near deaf. Swedish Netflix provide only
nordic language subtitles for most content. However, the internet is
full of `.srt` subtitles for almost everything. This plugin lets me
load .srt subtitles into a netflix movie and watch Netflix together
with my boyf.

Installation
------------

### Using tampermonkey

1. Install [tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algesten/nfsub/master/nfsub.user.js" target="_blank">nfsub script</a> by clicking this link *after* tampermonkey is installed.
3. Start playing a Netflix movie
4. In the subtitle menu, there's a "Load" button
5. Load your local .srt-file
6. Adjust timings with G and H (like VLC)

Example
-------

The load button is in the subtitles menu.

Subtitle are loaded and timings adjusted with G and H (like VLC). But not in fullscreen.

Keys in fullscreen
------------------

Due to security restrictions in HTML5 video, we can't capture keyboard
events when in fullscreen. To adjust timings, exit fullscreen and then
adjust.
